    "bio": "Hi there! I am Vini, born and raised in Brazil. My passion for tech have started because typing is better than writing (I have CP), even thought my carrer had started with managing Building Constructions and Maintence, and also after that IT Supervisor (with focus in infra), coding was always there. Before I start my own company at age 26 and work with tech, this experience above allow me to understand all processes inside a company and therefore help my clients to fully translate their requirements into code. Along this journey, I’ve realised that helping others to succeed and pursue their goals is my passion and purpose.",
